My project is about Multi class segmentation and classification non melanoma skin cancer
its about identifying and classifying the type of skin cancer. for four classes like bcc,scc,iec and healthy.

Domain of project : Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Objective of project : Skin Cancer is a major public health concern worldwide, so early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for successful treatment. 
However, traditional methods for cancer detection and diagnosis, such as manual observation and interpretation of medical images, can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error.
In an increasingly demanding environment for Pathologists, it is expected that deep learning methods can serve to improve the efficiency of pathologist workflows, such as in the case of diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer.
Deep learning and machine learning algorithms can accurately identify cancerous regions within medical images and classify them according to the type and severity of cancer. 
This can aid clinicians in making more informed treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.

Platform used :  google colab

Your Role :  I have build neural network(CNN) for classification as it classifies the skin cancer into four types like bcc, scc,iec and healthy and implemented machine learning classifiers 
		like random forest and k-nearest neighbour and compared the results

what i have learnt from this : 

Challenges faced and how did you overcome : As our dataset is too small and unbalanced so we did Image Augmentation techinques to increase the size of datasets,
